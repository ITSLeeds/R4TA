## Overview

This course teaches two skill-sets that are fundamental in modern transport research: programming and data analytics, with a focus on spatial data. Combining these enables powerful transport planning and analysis workflows for tackling a wide range of problems, including:

- How to effectively handle large transport datasets?
- Where to locate new transport infrastructure? 
- How to develop automated and reproducible transport planning workflows?
- How can increasingly available datasets on air quality, traffic and active travel be used to inform policy?
- How to visualise results in an attractive and potentially on-line and interactive manner?

This course will provide tools, example code and data and above all face-to-face teaching to empower participants with new software to answer these questions and more.
The focus is on the programming language R. However, the principles and skills learned will be cross-transferable to other languages. By providing strong foundations in spatial data handling and the use of an up-coming language for statistical computing, R for Transport Applications aims to open a world of possibilities for generating insight from your transport datasets for researchers in the public sector, academia and industry alike.

<!-- # Content -->

<!-- The **first day** will focus on how the R language works, general concepts in efficient R programming, and spatial and non-spatial data classes in R. Building on this strong foundation the **second day** will cover the application of the skills developed in Day 1 to transport datasets, with a focus on geographical transport data. -->

### Prerequisites

Prior experience with transport datasets or common geographic data formats is **essential.**

Some exposure to software with a command-line interface, such as Stata, Python and preferably R is **highly recommended**.
To get up-to-speed with R, please take time to set-up your computer with RStudio and work-through an on-line tutorial such as that provided by DataCamp (but run the commands on your computer not on-line): https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r

Attendees who are already proficient with their R programming skills are welcome to attend just the second day, although attendance of both days is recommended for most attendees: even advanced R users are likely to learn something on the first day.

**Computers** with RStudio installed will be available for course attendees. However, for maximum benefit, we recommend participants bring their own laptops, with the latest version of R installed.

Steps to set-up a suitable R/RStudio environment are described in sections [2.3](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#r-version) and [2.5](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#rstudio) of the book [Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html).

Please install the following packages are installed prior to attending the course:

```{r}
pkgs = c(
  "devtools",
  "spData",
  "dodgr",
  "sf",
  "stplanr",
  "tidyverse",
  "tmap",
  "openair"
)
```

These can be installed by running the previous chunk of code followed by:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(pkgs)
```

We will also use a 'GitHub package' that can be installed as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("nowosad/spDataLarge")
```

To test you have all these packages installed try to run the following commands - if you cannot, you may need to check the install process (you should see output like that below):

```{r}
# to load all the CRAN packages
purrr::map_lgl(pkgs, require, character.only= TRUE, quietly = TRUE) 
library(spDataLarge)  # to load spDataLarge
```
