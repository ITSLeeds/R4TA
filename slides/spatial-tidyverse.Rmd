This mini-workshop will introduce you to recent developments that enable work with spatial data 'in the tidyverse'. By this we mean handling spatial datasets using functions (such as ` %>% ` and `filter()`) and concepts (such as type stability) from R packages that are part of the metapackage **tidyverse**, which can now be installed from CRAN with the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

This functionality is possible thanks to **sf**, a recent package (first release in 2016) that implements the open standard data model *simple features*. Get **sf** with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
```

The workshop will briefly introduce both packages (which should be installed on your computer before attending) before demonstrating how they can work in harmony using a dataset from the **spData** package, which can be installed with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("spData")
```

The workshop is based on our work on the forthcoming book *Geocomputation with R* - please take a look at the book and its source code prior to the workshop here: [github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr).

## Context

- Software for 'data science' is evolving
- In R, packages **ggplot2** and **dplyr** have become immensely popular and now they are a part of the **tidyverse**
- These packages use the 'tidy data' principles for consistency and speed of processing (from `vignette("tidy-data")`):


>    - Each variable forms a column.
>    - Each observation forms a row.
>    - Each type of observational unit forms a table

- Historically spatial R packages have not been compatible with the **tidyverse**

## Enter sf

- **sf** is a recently developed package for spatial (vector) data
- Combines the functionality of three previous packages: **sp**, **rgeos** and **rgdal**
- Has many advantages, including:
    - Faster data I/O
    - More geometry types supported
    - Compatibility with the *tidyverse*
    
That's the topic of this workshop

##  Reproducibility

- You need the following pkgs

```{r}
library(sf)
library(spData)
library(tidyverse)
```

- Check it's all working, e.g. with this command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
world %>%
  plot()
```

---

## Reading and writing spatial data

```{r}
library(sf)
library(spData)
vector_filepath = system.file("shapes/world.gpkg", package = "spData")
vector_filepath
world = st_read(vector_filepath)
```

Counterpart to `st_read()` is the `st_write` function, e.g. `st_write(world, 'data/new_world.gpkg')`. A full list of supported formats could be found using `sf::st_drivers()`.

---

## Structure of the sf objects 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
world
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
print(world, n=3)
```

```{r}
class(world)
```

---

## Structure of the sf objects 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
world$name_long
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
world$name_long[1:3]
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
world$geom
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(world$geom, n = 3)
```

---
## sf vs sp


- The **sp** package is a predecessor of the **sf** package 
- Together with the **rgdal** and **rgeos** package, it creates a powerful tool to works with spatial data
- Many spatial R packages still depends on the **sp** package, therefore it is important to know how to convert **sp** to and from **sf** objects

```{r}
library(sp)
world_sp = as(world, "Spatial")
world_sf = st_as_sf(world_sp)
```

- The structures in the **sp** packages are more complicated - `str(world_sf)` vs `str(world_sp)`
  
- Moreover, many of the **sp** functions are not "pipeable" (it's hard to combine them with the **tidyverse**)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
world_sp %>% 
  filter(name_long == "England")
```

`Error in UseMethod("filter_") : 
  no applicable method for 'filter_' applied to an object of class "c('SpatialPolygonsDataFrame', 'SpatialPolygons', 'Spatial')"`

---

## Non-spatial operations on the sf objects

```{r, warning=FALSE}
world %>% 
  left_join(worldbank_df, by = "iso_a2") %>%
  select(name_long, pop, pop_growth, area_km2) %>%
  arrange(area_km2) %>% 
  mutate(pop_density = pop/area_km2) %>%
  rename(population = pop)
```

---

## Non-spatial operations

```{r}
world_cont = world %>% 
        group_by(continent) %>% 
        summarize(pop_sum = sum(pop, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(world_cont, n = 1)
```


- The `st_set_geometry` function can be used to remove the geometry column:

```{r}
world_df =st_set_geometry(world_cont, NULL)
class(world_df)
```

---

## Spatial operations

It's a big topic which includes:

- Spatial subsetting
- Spatial joining/aggregation
- Topological relations
- Distances
- Spatial geometry modification
- Raster operations (map algebra)

See [Chapter 4](http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-operations.html) of *Geocomputation with R* 

---

## Spatial subsetting

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
lnd_buff = lnd[1, ] %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 27700) %>%  # uk CRS
  st_buffer(500000) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 4326)
near_lnd = world[lnd_buff, ]
plot(near_lnd$geom)
```

- What is going with the country miles away?

---

## Multi-objects

Some objects have multiple geometries:

```{r}
st_geometry_type(near_lnd)
```

Which have more than 1?

```{r}
data.frame(near_lnd$name_long,
           sapply(near_lnd$geom, length))
```

---

## Subsetting contiguous polygons

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 6}
near_lnd_new = world %>% 
  st_cast(to = "POLYGON") %>% 
  filter(st_intersects(., lnd_buff, sparse = FALSE))
plot(near_lnd_new$geometry)
```

---

# Tidyverse pitfall 1: row names

You can also do tidy spatial subsetting:

```{r, message=FALSE}
near_lnd_tidy = world %>% 
  filter(st_intersects(., lnd_buff, sparse = FALSE))
```

But a) it's verbose and b) it boshes the row names!

```{r}
row.names(near_lnd_tidy)
row.names(near_lnd)
```

- Consequences for joining - rownames can be useful! 

Also affects non-spatial data - [tidyverse/dplyr#366](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/366)

---

# Tidyverse pitfall 2: Duplicate column names

See [edzer/sf#544](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/544)

```{r}
names(world)
names(lnd_buff)
```

```{r}
lnd_buff$iso_a2 = NA
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_intersection(world, lnd_buff) # works
world_tidy = st_as_sf(as_tibble(world))
st_intersection(world_tidy, lnd_buff) # fails
```

```
Error: Column `iso_a2` must have a unique name
```

---

# Tidyverse pitfall 3: binding rows


```{r, eval=FALSE}
rbind(near_lnd, near_lnd) # works
bind_rows(near_lnd, near_lnd)
```

```
Error in .subset2(x, i, exact = exact) : 
  attempt to select less than one element in get1index
```

But this does:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
near_lnd_data = st_set_geometry(near_lnd, NULL)
d = bind_rows(near_lnd_data, near_lnd_data)
d_sf = st_sf(d, geometry = c(near_lnd$geom, near_lnd$geom))
plot(d_sf)
```

---

## CRS

```{r}
na_2163 = world %>%
  filter(continent == "North America") %>% 
  st_transform(2163) #US National Atlas Equal Area
st_crs(na_2163)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
na = world %>%
  filter(continent == "North America") 
png('coord_compare.png', width = 1000, height = 250)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar=c(0,0,0,0))
plot(na[0]); plot(na_2163[0])
dev.off()
```

---
## Basic maps

- Basic maps of `sf` objects can be quickly created using the `plot()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(wrld[0])
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(wrld["pop"])
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
png('plot_compare.png', width = 800, height = 300)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar=c(0,0,1,0))
plot(world[0]);plot(world["pop"])
dev.off()
```

## leaflet

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
leaflet(world) %>%
        addTiles() %>%
        addPolygons(color = "#444444", weight = 1, fillOpacity = 0.5,
                    fillColor = ~colorQuantile("YlOrRd", lifeExp)(lifeExp),
                    popup = paste(round(world$lifeExp, 2)))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(widgetframe)
library('leaflet')
l = leaflet(world) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(color = "#444444", weight = 1, fillOpacity = 0.5, fillColor = ~colorQuantile("YlOrRd", lifeExp)(lifeExp), popup = paste(round(world$lifeExp, 2)))
frameWidget(l, height = '400')
```

---

## Raster data in the tidyverse

Raster data is not yet closely connected to the **tidyverse**, however:

- Some functions from the **raster** package works well in `pipes`
- You can convert vector data to the `Spatial*` form using `as(my_vector, "Spatial")`before working on raster-vector interactions
- There are some initial efforts to bring raster data closer to the **tidyverse**, such as [tabularaster](https://github.com/hypertidy/tabularaster), [sfraster](https://github.com/mdsumner/sfraster), or [fasterize](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/fasterize)
- The development of the [stars](https://github.com/r-spatial/stars), package focused on multidimensional, large datasets should start soon. It will allow pipe-based workflows
